### React Patterns

Implementation of some of the basic & advanced react patterns 👩‍🚀

- Compound Components
- Flexible Compound Components
- Render Props [WIP]
- Prop collection [WIP]
- Prop getters [WIP]

#### Compound Components

Compound component is a pattern to that such components share the state under the hood implicitly 
without configuration

#### Flexible Compound Components

Compound component is only applicaple to one level depth components. Using context we can apply implicit data sharing to deeper children.


#### Render props
Render props makes explict the implicit state that is achieved with compound components.
Gives full control over component state using children implicit props which lays between opening and closing jsx tags.
